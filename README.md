## Project Information
Our project is split into two parts, implementing a spatial skills test using Moodle, with the Code-Runner pluggin, and implemententing a prototype spatial skils game using Godot.

Code-Runner will be using traditional methods of spatial skills testing, using questions from studies and other tests. The reasoning behind using Code-Runner is the ease of use and the accessibility behind it as it is used by the tertiary sector. 

The game is a protoype that will be aimed at reinventing spatial skills testing, to make it more fun and enganging. The idea is to be able to test spatial skills without it feeling like a test. 

A majority of group planning and collaboration was done through a shared Google drive. Discussions were held through Discord and in-person.

**Code-Runner Technologies:**
- Moodle
- Code-Runner plugin for Moodle

**Game Technologies:**
- Godot

The first three games have instructions, although the last one does not. *insert directions*.

## Future Plans

**Database Addition**

We would like to add a databse to the game, storing all the data collected within the game. Making it simple for the teacher or admin to access player data and analyse and compare across all players. Thus, we have designed a database that we would like to implement in the future. Allowing for teacher and admin access, with data from each minigame stored in seperate tables for each player.

Database design is in the database folder, and everything is included in the [Database file](https://github.com/uoa-compsci399-s2-2023/capstone-project-team-32/tree/main/database).
