## Project Information
Our project is split into two parts, implementing a spatial skills test using Moodle, with the Code-Runner pluggin, and implemententing a prototype spatial skils game using Godot.

Code-Runner will be using traditional methods of spatial skills testing, using questions from studies and other tests. The reasoning behind using Code-Runner is the ease of use and the accessibility behind it as it is used by the tertiary sector. 

The game is a protoype that will be aimed at reinventing spatial skills testing, to make it more fun and enganging. The idea is to be able to test spatial skills without it feeling like a test. 

Our team used [Jira Software](https://spatial-skills-testing.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CBSST/boards/1) for our project management, with a majority of group collaboration done through a shared Google drive.

**Code-Runner Technologies:**
- Moodle
- Code-Runner plugin for Moodle

**Game Technologies:**
- Godot

## Installation and Configuration
To start an attempt of the Code-Runner Quiz, follow the steps below:

Once you are logged into Code-Runner, you will need to navigate to the correct quiz.

To install and run the game, firstly clone the game directory from the GutHub Respository

```
git clone https://github.com/uoa-compsci399-s2-2023/capstone-project-team-32.git
```

Then open the `game` folder and run the executable file. There is nothing but your Windows machine that is needed, so long as you have a a graphics card installed.

*confirm if we can have a mac version of the game or not*
