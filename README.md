## Project Information
Our project is split into two parts, implementing a spatial skills test using Moodle, with the Code-Runner pluggin, and implemententing a prototype spatial skils game using Godot.

Code-Runner will be using traditional methods of spatial skills testing, using questions from studies and other tests. The reasoning behind using Code-Runner is the ease of use and the accessibility behind it as it is used by the tertiary sector. 

The game is a protoype that will be aimed at reinventing spatial skills testing, to make it more fun and enganging. The idea is to be able to test spatial skills without it feeling like a test. 

Our team used [Jira Software](https://spatial-skills-testing.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/CBSST/boards/1) for our project management, with a majority of group collaboration done through a shared Google drive.

**Code-Runner Technologies:**
- Moodle
- Code-Runner plugin for Moodle

**Game Technologies:**
- Godot

## Installation and Configuration

### Code-Runner
To start an attempt of the Code-Runner Quiz, follow the steps below:

Once you are logged into Code-Runner, you will need to navigate to the correct quiz.

### ThinkSpatial Game

For both **Windows** and **macOS**, follow the below instructions for installing and setting up the game.

The game is stored in the GitHub repository, first you will need to clone the repository using the below command - ensure that you have git installed on your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/uoa-compsci399-s2-2023/capstone-project-team-32.git
```
Once you have the files on your machine, follow the steps below for your respective operating system.

**Windows**

Then open the `game` folder and run the executable file. There is nothing but your Windows machine that is needed, so long as you have a a graphics card installed.

**macOS**

Open the files, go into the `game` folder and find the `ThinkSpatial` file. Once located, open the file and the game should start running.

## Usage Examples - Code-Runner Quiz
To start the quiz, click the attempt quiz button.

You are able to submit your answer, by clicking the check button. However, there is a penatly for each time you clikc the check button and the answer is wrong. So do not click check unless you are sure that it is the correct answer.

## Usage Examples - ThinkSpatial Game

*wait until game merge and executable is finished*

## Future Plans

**Database Addition**

We would like to add a databse to the game, storing all the data collected within the game. Making it simple for the teacher or admin to access player data and analyse and compare across all players. Thus, we have designed a database that we would like to implement in the future. Allowing for teacher and admin access, with data from each minigame stored in seperate tables for each player.
